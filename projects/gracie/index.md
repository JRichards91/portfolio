# Gracie: Omnidirectional Autonomous Robot with Pick-and-Place Precision

**Gracie** is an advanced mobile robot platform designed to navigate dynamic environments, identify and retrieve objects, and interact with its surroundings. Built on a mecanum wheel chassis for full holonomic movement, Gracie combines precision mobility with intelligent manipulation through an integrated robotic arm.

## 🔧 About the Project

Gracie was engineered as a versatile robotics platform capable of:

- Room mapping using LiDAR and depth sensing
- Fully omnidirectional locomotion via mecanum wheels
- Autonomous pick-and-place with a robotic arm
- Local and remote control interface using a 7” touch screen
- Onboard processing powered by the Jetson Orin Nano

The platform was designed from the ground up with modularity and customization in mind — all major components are securely mounted using custom 3D-printed hardware.
