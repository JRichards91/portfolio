# HiveMind: Multi-Agent Route Optimization in Python

**HiveMind** is a Python-based implementation of the Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP), designed to optimize the path planning of multiple agents across a shared set of waypoints. This model simulates coordination between autonomous agents tasked with covering distinct routes efficiently â€” a critical problem in logistics, robotics, and swarm systems.

## ðŸ”§ About the Project

This project solves the multi-agent variant of the classic TSP using custom heuristics, clustering algorithms, and matplotlib-based visualizations. Each agent receives a subset of cities to visit, and the solution aims to minimize both the total travel cost and the workload variance between agents.

This system was developed as a foundation for exploring multi-agent coordination and distributed planning.

### Features:
- Random or user-defined city maps
- Customizable number of agents
- Euclidean cost metrics between nodes
- k-means clustering for route partitioning
- 2-opt and greedy heuristics for intra-route optimization
- Real-time matplotlib visualization of agent paths
