      <h2>My Engineering Journey</h2>
      <p>I’m Justin Richards, an Electrical & Computer Engineer with a passion for making ideas tangible. At Eastern Washington University, I mastered circuit design and embedded systems, culminating in a fully automated hydroponics system for my senior capstone. Everything from sensor integration to fluid delivery was my responsibility—learn more on the <a href="{{ '/projects/smart-hydro/' | relative_url }}">Projects page</a>.</p>

      <h2>3D Printing Enthusiast</h2>
      <p>When hardware needs a custom touch, my 3D printer is my best friend. I design and print enclosures, mechanical linkages, and rapid prototypes that speed up development. This hands‑on approach lets me iterate quickly and solve on‑the‑spot challenges in my robotics and sensor projects.</p>

      <h2>Outdoor Inspiration with Pi</h2>
      <p>My dog Pi and I explore the Pacific Northwest together, seeking new trails and secret “SniffSpots.” These adventures recharge my creativity and often spark fresh project ideas—whether it’s a rugged outdoor sensor platform or an all‑terrain rover for forest mapping.</p>

      <h2>Robotics & Automation</h2>
      <p>My latest build is a ROS2 robot with a 3D camera and manipulator arm, powered by the Jetson Orin Nano. It navigates autonomously, identifies objects, and performs pick‑and‑place tasks. I’m constantly refining its software stack—explore this project on the <a href="{{ '/projects/ros2-camera-arm/' | relative_url }}">Projects page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Smart Gardening</h2>
      <p>I’m developing a wireless moisture sensor that integrates with Apple HomeKit to automate indoor plant care. With battery‑powered soil probes and Wi‑Fi alerts, it ensures your garden stays healthy even when you’re away. Future plans include solar charging and predictive watering schedules.</p>
