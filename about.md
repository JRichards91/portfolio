    <p>Hello, I’m Justin Richards, an Electrical & Computer Engineer and Eastern Washington University graduate. I discovered my passion for robotics, embedded systems, and circuit design while developing a fully automated hydroponics system—see it on the <a href="{{ '/projects/smart-hydro/' | relative_url }}">Projects page</a>.</p>

    <p>I thrive on turning ideas into functioning devices, whether I'm programming microcontrollers or designing custom 3D-printed parts. 3D printing lets me solve problems faster and iterate on my projects in real time.</p>

    <p>When I’m not building or coding, you’ll find me exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog, Pi. We find new trails and nature spots—those adventures always inspire my next project.</p>

    <p>My latest project is a ROS2 robot with a 3D camera and arm, powered by a Jetson Orin Nano—check it out in the <a href="{{ '/projects/ros2-camera-arm/' | relative_url }}">Projects section</a>. Next up: a wireless smart soil moisture sensor that works with Apple HomeKit to keep indoor gardens thriving.</p>

    <p>Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrichards91" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or visit my <a href="{{ '/resume/' | relative_url }}">Resume</a> page for more details.</p>
