  <p>Hello, I’m Justin Richards, an Electrical & Computer Engineer. I graduated from Eastern Washington University, where I discovered a passion for robotics, embedded systems, and circuit design. For my senior capstone, I designed, built, and programmed a fully automated hydroponics system—take a look on the <a href="{{ '/projects/smart-hydro/' | relative_url }}">Projects page</a>.</p>

  <p>Embedded systems are my playground—I love diving into firmware, crafting custom PCBs, and solving real‑world problems in code. When hardware and software merge smoothly, that’s when projects truly come alive. I’m also an avid 3D printing enthusiast, creating custom parts that improve everything from robotics to home gadgets.</p>

  <p>When I’m not in the lab, I’m out exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog, Pi. We hunt down the best trails and “SniffSpots,” and each new adventure sparks ideas for my next automation project. Those long hikes are as much about fresh air as they are about fresh inspiration.</p>

  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/ros2-camera-arm.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="ROS2 robot with camera and arm">
  <p>My latest creation is a ROS2 robot equipped with a 3D camera and robotic arm, powered by a Jetson Orin Nano. It navigates, senses, and manipulates objects, showcasing the power of open‑source robotics frameworks. Check it out on the <a href="{{ '/projects/ros2-camera-arm/' | relative_url }}">Projects page</a>.</p>

  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/homekit-moisture-sensor.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="HomeKit moisture sensor prototype">
  <p>Up next: I’m developing a wireless moisture sensor that integrates with Apple HomeKit, so indoor plants stay hydrated automatically—even when I’m away. Growing smart gardens is the perfect blend of engineering and nature, and I can’t wait to share the final design.</p>
