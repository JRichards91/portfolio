      <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
      <p>Growing up in Oregon, Connecticut, and Washington, I was the kid who couldn’t resist taking apart gadgets just to see how they worked. My grandfather, a civil engineer, inspired me to follow in his footsteps—only I gravitated toward electrical systems. By the time I graduated with a BS in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Eastern Washington University, I had already interned as an electrical engineering tech and drafter while juggling full‑time coursework. Those early experiences laid the foundation for turning curiosity into practical solutions.</p>

      <h2>Early Tinkering & Learning</h2>
      <p>As a child, I was relentless—if something moved or lit up, I had to know why. My first “aha” moment came at 2½ years old when I taught myself to ride a bike in a single afternoon, determined to keep up with my older sister. Fast‑forward to 2020, I was building a closet with my mom and realized how rewarding hands‑on work could be. Each scrape and rebuild taught me that perseverance and curiosity go hand in hand.</p>

      <h2>Engineering Passions & Skills</h2>
      <p>My go‑to tools are Python and C, especially on the Tiva C dev kit, Raspberry Pi, and Pi Pico platforms. Before ordering parts, I dive deep into research—drawing schematics, simulating circuits, and mapping workflows. Whenever possible, I prototype on breadboards to iron out wrinkles in firmware and hardware integration. That methodical approach turned proof‑of‑concept hydroponics in 2025 from a dream into reality.</p>

      <h2>Bringing Robots to Life</h2>
      <p>Robotics is where my love of software meets my passion for mechanics. I recently completed a ROS2 robot equipped with a 3D camera and arm, powered by the Jetson Orin Nano. From integrating SLAM navigation to fine‑tuning pick‑and‑place routines, every step taught me the beauty of open‑source frameworks. Seeing autonomous motion for the first time never gets old.</p>

      <h2>Life Outside the Lab</h2>
      <p>When I unplug, you’ll find me outdoors with Pi, my eight‑month‑old English Cream Golden Retriever. We hit our favorite SniffSpot in Mead, WA or explore hidden trails across the Pacific Northwest. Pi’s boundless energy and curious nose remind me to stay playful and observant—qualities that feed back into my engineering projects. Every uphill climb or lakeside town adds ideas for my next build.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>Beyond the lab, I love live music, travel, and discovering Central Oregon’s scenic wonders. Professionally, I’m exploring a master’s degree and dreaming up my next big build: a custom 3D‑printed enclosure and PCB for a wireless HomeKit‑compatible soil moisture sensor. My goal is to blend elegance and engineering to create smart gardens that practically care for themselves.
