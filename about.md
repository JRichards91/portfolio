    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Justin Richards</strong>, an Electrical & Computer Engineer. I graduated from Eastern Washington University, where I honed my skills in circuit design and firmware development.</p>

    <p>My passion lies in <em>embedded systems</em>—from programming low‑power microcontrollers to architecting sensor networks that integrate seamlessly with HomeKit. Outside the lab, I’m an avid <em>3D printing</em> enthusiast, constantly iterating on custom enclosures and mechanical parts.</p>

    <p>When I’m not soldering or slicing G-code, you’ll find me exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog, Nova. We hunt down new hiking trails and sniffspots—each adventure fuels fresh ideas for my next automation project.</p>

    <p>My latest obsession is <em>automated robotics</em>: designing rovers that recharge themselves, vision‑guided drones, and DIY robotic arms. Building systems that sense, decide, and act without tethering me to a keyboard is what drives me forward.</p>
