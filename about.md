    <p>Hello, I’m <strong>Justin Richards</strong>, an Electrical &amp; Computer Engineer with a heart wired for creativity. I graduated from Eastern Washington University, where I discovered my passion for robotics, embedded systems, and circuit design. For my senior capstone, I conceptualized and built a fully automated smart hydroponics system—check it out on the <a href="{{ '/projects/smart-hydro/' | relative_url }}">Projects page</a>!</p>

    <p>Embedded systems and automation are my playground: from programming microcontrollers to architecting complex robotics, I love making machines think and act. Outside the lab, I’m an avid <em>3D printing</em> enthusiast—designing custom parts to improve my home and solve challenges in my projects.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding, soldering, or slicing G‑code, you’ll find me exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog, <strong>Pi</strong>. We chase new hiking trails and sniff out the best “SniffSpots,” where Pi can roam free and I get inspiration for my next automation.</p>

    <p>My latest obsession is automated robotics: I recently finished building a ROS2 robot with a 3D camera and arm, powered by a Jetson Orin Nano—see it in the <a href="{{ '/projects/ros2-camera-arm/' | relative_url }}">Projects section</a>. I’m also dreaming up a wireless smart soil moisture sensor that integrates with Apple HomeKit, so my indoor garden stays hydrated even when I’m away.</p>

    <p>Outside of engineering, you might catch me tinkering with home‑brew coffee recipes or sketching concept art for my next invention. Life’s an adventure, and I’m building the future one project at a time.</p>
