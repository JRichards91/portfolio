    <p>Hello! I’m Justin Richards, an Electrical & Computer Engineer driven by the thrill of bringing hardware to life. Ever since my first soldering iron experience, I’ve been hooked on embedded systems—from fine-tuning microcontroller firmware to architecting low-power sensor networks.</p>
    <p>When I’m not peering through a logic analyzer, you’ll often find me at my 3D printer, iterating on custom enclosures and mechanical parts. 3D printing lets me blend CAD creativity with hands-on building—nothing beats holding a prototype you designed and watched grow layer by layer.</p>
    <p>Outside the lab, I’m happiest exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog, Nova. We hunt down new sniffspots and hiking trails—each adventure fuels fresh ideas for my next side project.</p>
