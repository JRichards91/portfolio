      <h2>Born to Tinker, Wired to Explore</h2>
      <p>Growing up across Oregon, Connecticut, and Washington, I was always in motion—on a soccer field, behind a lacrosse stick, or tearing down a trail on my mountain bike. My curiosity didn’t stop at the finish line. If something beeped, blinked, or flew, I had to know how it worked. While living in Connecticut, I discovered lacrosse and fell in love with the game. After moving to Washington, I earned a varsity spot by sophomore year and was recruited to a top-tier summer camp. That same competitive spirit now drives my engineering work.</p>

      <h2>Hands-On Learning, From Trails to Tech</h2>
      <p>My love for mechanics was shaped just as much on the trails as in the garage. I spent countless weekends exploring Black Diamond’s network of mountain bike paths and rode the Hiawatha Trail in Montana with my mom in 2022—a ride I’ll never forget. In 2018, I taught myself to solder while fixing micro drones, and that hands-on experience lit the fuse. Now I’m right at home with a soldering iron, prototyping new ideas with confidence and precision.</p>

      <h2>Designing with Direction</h2>
      <p>Driven by a passion for problem-solving, I pursued a BS in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Eastern Washington University. While balancing a full course load, I interned as an electrical engineering technician and drafter—translating classroom theory into real-world insight. My go‑to tools are Python and C, especially on embedded systems like the Tiva C dev kit, Raspberry Pi, and Pico. Every project starts with research, schematics, simulations, and careful prototyping. That rigor helped bring my 2025 hydroponics concept from sketch to working system.</p>

      <h2>Giving Robots a Purpose</h2>
      <p>Robotics is where software meets the physical world. I recently built a ROS2-powered mobile robot with a 3D camera and robotic arm, running on the Jetson Orin Nano. From SLAM navigation to precision pick‑and‑place movements, each step deepened my appreciation for the power of open-source systems. Watching something I built make autonomous decisions never gets old—it’s pure magic backed by code.</p>

      <h2>Outside the Lab</h2>
      <p>When I’m not soldering or coding, you’ll find me outside with Pi—my English Cream Golden Retriever. We hike SniffSpots near Spokane, wander through Central Oregon, or just explore hidden trails. Pi’s curiosity reminds me to stay playful, stay learning, and stay present. It’s that sense of wonder I try to bring into every prototype, every bug fix, and every new idea.</p>

      <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
      <p>I’m currently designing a smart, wireless soil moisture sensor with a custom PCB and 3D‑printed enclosure—HomeKit‑compatible and built for seamless integration. It’s part of a bigger vision: blending elegant design with embedded intelligence to create tech that supports sustainability and self-sufficiency. If that spark resonates, let’s connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrichards91" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>—I’d love to share ideas.</p>
