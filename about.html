        <p>Hello! I’m Justin Richards, an Electrical & Computer Engineer driven by the thrill of bringing hardware to life. Ever since my first soldering iron experience, 
          I’ve been hooked on embedded systems—from fine‑tuning microcontroller firmware to architecting low‑power sensor networks. Whether it’s writing bare‑metal drivers 
          for an RP2040 or optimizing ESP32-based HomeKit integrations, I love the challenge of making tiny circuits perform big tasks.</p>
        <p>When I’m not peering through a logic analyzer, you’ll often find me at my 3D printer, iterating on custom enclosures and mechanical parts. 
          3D printing lets me blend CAD creativity with hands‑on building—nothing beats holding a prototype you designed and watched grow layer by layer. 
          I’ve prototyped everything from robotic joint housings to wireless sensor mounts, and I’m always exploring new materials and print techniques.</p>
        <p>Outside the lab, I’m happiest exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog, Nova. We hunt down new sniffspots and hiking trails—the wilder, the better. 
          Those long walks fuel fresh ideas for my next side project (and give Nova plenty of new smells to investigate).</p>
        <p>Lately, I’ve been diving into automated robotics, combining my love of embedded programming with mechanical design. From docking stations that recharge autonomously 
          to vision‑guided rovers, I thrive on building systems that sense, decide, and act—all without constant human input.</p>
        <p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and view my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yourresume.pdf?dl=0" 
          target="_blank">Resume to learn more about my background and projects.</a>.</p>
